# Real-Time E-commerce Customer Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview 
Impact: 15-25% revenue increase potential  
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly  

## Business Challenge
High churn rate (54.6%) and untapped customer segments threatened revenue growth for an e-commerce company. Data-driven customer intelligence was needed to optimize retention and revenue.

## What I Did
- Performed RFM analysis with 9 distinct customer segments
